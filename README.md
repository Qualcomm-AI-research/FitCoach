Here we provide the code to evaluate the baseline Stream-VLM model in the paper:

[**Live Fitness Coaching as a Testbed for Situated Interaction (NeurIPS 2024 D&B Track)
**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08101)

## Abstract

Vision-language models have shown impressive progress in recent years. However, existing models are
largely limited to turn-based interactions, where each turn must be stepped (i.e., prompted) by the
user. Open-ended, asynchronous interactions, where an AI model may proactively deliver timely
responses or feedback based on the unfolding situation in real-time, are an open challenge. In the
paper "Live Fitness Coaching as a Testbed for Situated Interaction (NeurIPS 2024 D&B Track)", we
present the QEVD benchmark and dataset, which explores human-AI interaction in the challenging, yet
controlled, real-world domain of fitness coaching -- a task which intrinsically requires monitoring
live user activity and providing immediate feedback. The benchmark requires vision-language models
to recognize complex human actions, identify possible mistakes, and provide appropriate feedback in
real-time. Our experiments reveal the limitations of existing state-of-the-art vision-language
models for such asynchronous situated interactions. Motivated by this, we propose a simple
end-to-end streaming baseline (Stream-VLM model) that can respond asynchronously to human actions
with appropriate feedback at the appropriate time. This repository contains the code to evaluate
the baseline Stream-VLM model.

## Running the Code

### Getting Started

First, clone the repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Qualcomm-AI-research/FitCoach.git $REPO_PATH
cd $REPO_PATH
```

Here, *$REPO_PATH* is the desired location to download the repository.

Next, build a docker image with the project requirements using the following command:

```
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile --tag fitcoach:latest .
```

Next, start a docker container from the built image:

```
docker run --gpus all --name fitcoach -it --rm fitcoach
```

### Download Checkpoints

First, download the LLaMA-2-7B checkpoint available [here](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b). Next, download the weights of the 3D CNN and the Stream-VLM model,

```
wget --no-check-certificate -P ./ckpts_efficientnet https://github.com/Qualcomm-AI-research/FitCoach/releases/download/v1.0/efficientnet_3d_cnn_weights.tar.gz
wget --no-check-certificate -P ./ckpts_streamvlm https://github.com/Qualcomm-AI-research/FitCoach/releases/download/v1.0/streamvlm_weights.tar.gz
``` 

The above commands will download the 3D CNN and the Stream-VLM model weights to *./ckpts_efficientnet* and *./ckpts_streamvlm* respectively. These paths can be updated as necessary, please update the *docker run* command to mount the volume for these paths in the docker container.

Finally, to obtain the LLM-Acc metric download the LLaMA-3-70B-Instruct weights (and tokenizer) available [here](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct).

### Data Extraction

Next, download the [QEVD](https://www.qualcomm.com/developer/software/qevd-dataset) dataset. To evaluate the Stream-VLM model only the QEVD-FIT-COACH benchmark needs to be downloaded. After download, the
EfficientNet 3D CNN features used by the Stream VLM model can be extracted using the following
command:

```
python scripts/extract_efficientnet_features.py --data_dir <Path to the downloaded QEVD dataset.> --model_dir <EfficientNet 3D CNN model weights path> --fit_coach_benchmark
```

Use the `--fit_coach_benchmark` flag to extract the features for the QEVD-FIT-COACH benchmark
and the `--fit_coach_dataset` flag for the QEVD dataset. By default the features will be
extracted to *EFFICIENTNET_FEATURES_DIR* within the QEVD dataset folder.

### Evaluation

To evaluate interactive feedback generated by the Stream-VLM model, use the following command:

```
PYTHONPATH=./ python scripts/evaluate_baseline.py --config configs/base.yaml
```

Set the path to the downloaded LLaMA-2-7B weights (*llama2_7b_path*) and the Stream-VLM weights (
*checkpoint_path*) in `configs/base.yaml`. Set the path to the downloaded QEVD dataset (and
extracted features) in *data_root*. The generated feedbacks will be saved to the path specified by
*feedbacks_save_path* and *feedbacks_save_file_name* json file.

The above script generates the METEOR, ROUGE-L, BERT and Temporal F-scores along with the json
result file (at *feedbacks_save_path/feedbacks_save_file_name.json*). To obtain the LLM-Accuracy use
the following command:

```
python scripts/get_llm_accuracy.py --results_file <Path to the generated json results file> --llm_model_path <Path to the directory containing LLaMA-3-70B-Instruct weights> --llm_tokenizer_path <Path to the directory containing LLaMA-3-70B-Instruct tokenizer (usually same as llm_model_path and can be ignored)>
```

The path to the generated json results file should be
*feedbacks_save_path/feedbacks_save_file_name.json*.

Running the commands above should reproduce the following results reported in the paper:

| METEOR | ROUGE-L | BERT  | LLM-Acc | T-F-Score |
|--------|---------|-------|---------|-----------|
| 0.127  | 0.112   | 0.862 | 2.45    | 0.56      |

### Compute Requirements

We recommend the use of a GPU with at least 48GB VRAM along with at least 32GB of RAM.
